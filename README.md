# imp_HttpBootstrapTemplateWithAjaxJQuery
A standard bootstrap template customised to auto grab status data using JQuery + Ajax from up to 3 Imp Agent URLs and get Imp Agent to respond to on/off button presses. It will auto update every 20 seconds using JQuery setTimeout. As yet the code does not do a proper check to make sure that the initial ajax instruction is complete before next timer triggers so not advisable to reduce auto updates below say 8 seconds, to be sure.
